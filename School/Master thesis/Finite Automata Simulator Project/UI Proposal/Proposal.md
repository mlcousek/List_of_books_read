## OP VERSION - HOME

1. On the top I want simple navbar with login, home, shared automatons ...
	1. if you are logged in you can have your saved automatons and circle photo of your profile photo or just default value photo or picture 
2. there will be canvas where you can start creating your own automat with mouse with options 
	1. there will be also action buttons add state, add transition and delete 
3. here will be also insert automaton option where you can insert text value of the automaton and then press button and automaton will change also when you edit the automaton with mouse on canvas it will change this text representation
4. And load automaton option will be also there.
5. Also here will be the option to change between the automatons like DFA, NFA, epsilon-NFA etc.

This will be the main home page

1. if there will be any automaton then the Input will appear and navbar with execute step, step back, execute all, back to start and this debug options will appear
