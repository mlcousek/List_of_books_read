The [[Program.cs]] file serves as the entry point and configuration hub for this ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application focused on Finite Automata. It sets up the web application host, configures services, establishes database connectivity, and defines the HTTP request pipeline.

Key Features
•	Environment-specific configuration with optional development settings
•	SQL Server database integration
•	ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication
•	Registration of finite automaton classes ([[DFA]], [[NFA]], [[EpsilonNFA]])
•	Complete HTTP request pipeline with standard security measures
•	Support for both MVC and Razor Pages patterns

This configuration establishes a web application focused on finite automaton operations with user authentication, database persistence, and standard web security measures.
