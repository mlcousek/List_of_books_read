This Obsidian document provides an overview of the [[Finite Automata]] Simulator project, including its structure, components, and relationships.

This is MVC (Model - View - Controller) project and i separate this parts to own projects. Models are in [[FiniteAutomatons.Core]] project. Views are in [[FiniteAutomatons]] web app project and Controllers are also in [[FiniteAutomatons]] project. 

This solution has this projects:
- [[FiniteAutomatons]]
- [[FiniteAutomatons.Core]]
- [[FiniteAutomatons.Data]]
- [[FiniteAutomatons.Services]]

For this application I am also creating [[Tests]]. They are in folder tests and for this project are implemented [Unit Tests] and [[Integration Tests]].
