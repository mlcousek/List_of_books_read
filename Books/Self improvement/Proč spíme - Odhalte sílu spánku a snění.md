This is book which changed my mind on sleeping, nightlife and getting up early.

One thing that I would point on one thing and that is that sleeping and good quality sleeping is really important to good quality and mental quality and long life. 

It changed my mind and after I read this book I want always to sleep at least 7 hours but it is really the minimum!

Even though I've learned a lot, it took me a while to read. I struggled with this book and read it at least one and half year. It has lot of good things and ideas, but also lots of studies and some boring chapters.
