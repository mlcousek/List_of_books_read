 [[Jordan B. Peterson]] offers readers twelve principles for a happier and more meaningful life in accordance with conscience and deeper ethical values.  

The author analyses such topics as self-discipline, freedom, the meaning of life, the value of God, proper child-rearing, and ethical interpretation of Christian teachings. Drawing on his own experience, psychotherapeutic practice, and reflection on examples from the history of thought, he analyses life in philosophical, social, moral, psychological, and spiritual terms and advises how to live it without prejudice and in harmony with God. 

Peterson's goal is to give readers the tools to find stability and meaning in a chaotic world through practical advice and insightful reflection. His narrative style and many insights make this book an inspiring guide to personal development.
