### My Internship at Monet+

Right now, I am doing an internship at Monet+. I go regularly to their office in Olomouc, where I work as part of the **Identity Payments** team. My team leader is **[[Zdeněk Drlík]]**, who helps me understand the projects and gives me useful advice. During the internship, I have learned a lot about identity systems, security, coding and how real software is made in a company. Everyone in the team is friendly and helpful.

I really enjoy my time at Monet+, and I hope I can continue working there in the future. I think it's a great place to grow, learn, and work on interesting technologies that matter in the real world.
