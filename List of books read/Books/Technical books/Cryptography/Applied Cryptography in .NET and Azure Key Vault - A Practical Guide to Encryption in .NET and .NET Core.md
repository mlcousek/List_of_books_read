This was great book about cryptography which i had to read to my work. And it was also first book which I fully read in English language so a really big step for me. 

I really enjoyed this book! It's a great hands-on guide for anyone interested in applied cryptography within the .NET ecosystem. The practical examples and clear explanations made complex topics approachable and directly useful. As someone genuinely interested in this field, I appreciated how the book connects real-world security practices with modern .NET and Azure tools. Highly recommended for developers who want to deepen their understanding of encryption and secure coding in .NET.
