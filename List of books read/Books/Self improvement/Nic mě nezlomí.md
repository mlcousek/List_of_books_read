Reading _Can’t Hurt Me_ by [[David Goggins]] was one of the most powerful and motivating experiences I’ve ever had. From start to finish, this book completely captured my attention and made a deep impact on how I see mental strength, discipline, and the human potential to push beyond limits. I absolutely loved every chapter and couldn’t put it down.

David Goggins’ life story is raw, honest, and intense. He doesn’t sugarcoat anything — from his incredibly difficult childhood to the brutal challenges he faced in adulthood. What makes this book so special is not just the incredible stories he shares, but the lessons he teaches along the way. Goggins shows that pain, suffering, and hardship can be turned into fuel for personal growth and mental toughness.

What I especially enjoyed — and what stood out the most for me — were the chapters where he talked about marathons, ultramarathons, and triathlons. As someone interested in endurance sports, I was completely fascinated by these parts of the book. The way Goggins pushed himself through distances and physical pain was mind-blowing. His first 100-mile race, where he ran through injuries and severe exhaustion, truly showed what it means to embrace suffering and keep going when every part of your body tells you to stop. The triathlon chapters also opened my eyes to how much preparation, discipline, and mental control it takes to compete in such grueling events.

What inspired me the most is how Goggins uses these challenges to strengthen not just his body, but his mind. His idea of "The 40% Rule" — that when we think we're done, we're only at 40% of our potential — stuck with me the most. It made me realize how much more I might be capable of if I just stop making excuses and start pushing harder.

_Can’t Hurt Me_ is more than just a book — it’s a mindset. It’s a challenge to look at your own life, your own limits, and ask yourself if you’re really giving it your all. After reading it, I felt motivated not only to train harder physically, but to take on life with a stronger, more determined mindset. Goggins proves that ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things through sheer willpower and hard work.

In short, I truly, deeply enjoyed this book. It was amazing, intense, and life-changing. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for motivation, especially those interested in endurance sports or overcoming tough life circumstances. _Can’t Hurt Me_ left a mark on me, and I’ll definitely come back to it again and again whenever I need a reminder of what I’m truly capable of.
